Welcome to the Video Library Hub!
# Video Library Hub
This is a place where professors post their reserved digital materials for student to preview lessons, do homework and review for exams. And for each student to collect required materials of all his professors in his own Video Library Hub account.  

## Aiming Problem + Propose Description
Sometimes it was hard for student to remember and collect all the reserved videos by their professors of each courses and got lost in too many opened Chrome tabs. This Video library Hub provide a platform for student that they can get all these digital materials at one stop, and save the ones needed for their own study use. Also, Video Library Hub give professors a place to post their reserved videos online anytime they like, rather than sent group emails or post a link on Piazza, they won't worry this get flushed by other information.

## Roles
Three roles in this project: `Faculty`, `Student`, `Admin`. 
  `Visitor` are allowed only for limited functions.

### Faculty
Each Faculty user has their distinguished account to deploy reserved digital materials on the website, which is opening for their students. They can add and delete certain videos, and maintain the course list by managing material names and descriptions. 

### Student
Each Student user has their distinguished account to `watch` videos that reserved by professors. Each Student user can `like` the videos and collect them in his own list, which enable student to find them directly next time. 
  In order to achieve the prerequisite and get additional tutorials, they can also `search` videos in their own home page. In the result page, there's a list of 5 related tutorials available, and they can always `like` the helpful ones into their own video list.

### Admin
Each Admin user has their distinguished account to maintain other users' accounts in this website. Apart from managing the website itself, they are able to change other users' personal informations, such that their names, post or liked videos. Apart from that, they are able to delete users in the other two roles if necessary.

## Demo Helper

  This is an explanation of Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest path between one vertex in a graph and another. Indeed, this explains how Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm generates a set of information that includes the shortest paths from a starting vertex and every other vertex in the graph.
